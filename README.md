# SPI Implementation using Verilog HDL

Description:

SPI is a synchronous, full duplex, single master - multiple slaves based interface used to send data between a controller and smaller peripherals like ADCs, shift registers, etc.

HDL: Verilog

EDA Tool: Xilinx Vivado

Results:

• Designed an RTL of SPI Master using Verilog HDL.

• Wrote a Verilog Testbench to simulate transactions on MISO line for all the four operating modes.
